This is the solution statement for Microsoft code fun do++. 

  Weather forecast will alarm us the chances of flood conditions in the specific area. 
The idea I am going to present will utilize three things. First map of the area where flood can occur may be google maps with topographical system of the area second mobile tracking system that tracks the location of all mobiles in the location and lastly a SMS system that makes mass SMS to all the people in the area.  

  If there are conditions of flood in the area and weather reports the timing of occurrence then we will immediately track the location of all the peoples in the city/state and by topography of the area we will prepare a report which is the nearest high lying area to that person if the flood is going to occur within hours. The high lying area if possible must contain hospitals and market and must be secured from flooding conditions. Then we will SMS all the people which route they have to follow to save their lives from flood so that there is no traffic jam due to haphazard movement of all individuals. The SMS will also contain what all they must carry for their survival. If we have enough time a mail will automatically be sent to rescue forces so that they will prepare themselves to rescue people from remote area. 
  
  If the flood persists then we can send rescue forces via air to the defined places when people have assembled. Rescue forces will carry the basic needs of people as well the extra needs of specific people like medicines which they will specify via SMS to a generated rescue number. 
  
  In the end if people have lost their homes in the flood conditions then we can setup rescue camps and collect donation money from the people of India via online apps like paytm, phonePe and help them with their houses.
